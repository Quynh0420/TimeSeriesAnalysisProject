# How would you interpret results of the model above?

# parameter 0.826820 describes a short term relationship

# commodity 1 in the SHORT RUN will increase by 0.826820

# the long run relationship is described by the parameter
# 0.819131 from the cointegrating relationship:
# so if commodity 2 increases by 1 in the LONG RUN commodity 1 will 
# increase by 0.819131

# -0.014008 is the adjustment coefficient
# its sign is negative (as expected)
# its value means that 1.4% of the unexpected 
# error (increase in gap) will be corrected 
# in the next period, so any unexpected deviation
# should be corrected finally within about 71.4 periods (1/1.4%)

################################################################################

# Now let's check, whether index Granger causes future and vice versa.
# What is the proper lag length in this case? 

# 3 lags
granger.test(data2.xts[,1:2], # set of variables tested
             3) # lag assumed

# 4 lags
granger.test(data2.xts[,1:2], 4)

# 5 lags
granger.test(data2.xts[,1:2], 5)

# 12 lags
granger.test(data2.xts[,1:2], 12)

# What is the conclusion? 
# At approximately 0% significance level we have so called
# 'bi-directional feedback' in case of 4 lags 
# which means there is Granger causality between 2 commodities
# with other cases (3, 5, 12 lags), the significance level is around 1% to 7%
# maybe this indicates that the length of 4 lags is the most appropriate 
# for the forecast of 2 commodities
